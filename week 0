5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects: Effects of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful

People can create computing innovations The way people finish tasks usually changes to include new computing innovations Not every effect of a computing innovation can be predicted in advance A signal effect can be seen either as beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person Advances in computing have increased creativity in fields such as medicine and engineering
Computing innovations can have an long lasting impact Computing innovation can be used in ways that they were not originally intended Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a negative impact on society

5.1:

Some benefits of computing is that the internet allows for faster spread of information. However, this can also lead to misinformation and the spread of things that are not actually true. Another benefit is video games that can be used to play with people all over the world and can help people connect. However, this can lead to cyberbullying and expose children to dangerous people. Lastly, social media helps to connect with lots of people but accoutns can get hacked and become dangerous.
Dopamine directly relates to the pleasure we feel in the brain by neurotransmitters. I do think it is real because it distracts me from doing homework sometimes. FOr example, if I start watching a Netflix show, I want to keep watching because it keeps me engaged and happy and I end up watching multiple episodes instead of doing my work
5.2:

Someone could empower themselves in the digital world by being more familiar with technology and how they function
Someone that is empowered can help those who are not by sharing their knowledge and providing them with resources if possible. At Del Norte, I could help people who are not as familiar with computers and help them be more comfortable with them
Yes it is blocking digital empowerment because it restricts us from doing certain things. At Del Nirte the wifi restricts us from certain sites which prevents us from seeing our own websites in Computer Science
