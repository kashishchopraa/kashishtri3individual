Week 1

5.3-5.4 Notes:

5.3 Computing Bias

Bias exists in different computing innovations
Computing innovations reflect human biases that already exist because of biases written into the algorithms or in the data used by the innovation
Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations to combat existing human biases
Biases can be used at all levels of software development

5.4 Crowdsourcing: Exploring the advantages of a computer’s reach

People participate in problem-solving processes at scale
Widespread access to information and public data allows the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results
Science has been affected by using “citizen science” to solve problems
Citizen science is scientific research conducted by distributed individuals, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the internet
Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing
Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding

Github Actions:

5.3 Computing Bias
1) I think that the owner did not think this was intentional
2) He did not think it was intentional
3) I believe this happened because of the lack of testing among different races 
4) Yes I think this is harmful
5) To fix this, development teams should make sure they have more duverse teams to ensure everyone has a say and is not biased towards because of their race or ethnicity

5.4 Crowdsourcing: Exploring the advantages of a computer’s reach
1) A Crowdsource idea is asking a question through a poll on the slack channel because all of the CS students use that platform
2) For Del Norte crowdsourcing you could use a google form and send it our via canvas for all students to respond to
